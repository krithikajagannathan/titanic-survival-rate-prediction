# Titanic Survival Rate Prediction

This repository contains the code for predicting the survival rates of passengers on the Titanic using machine learning techniques. The analysis is performed using Python, with a focus on feature engineering, data visualization, and model building.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to build a predictive model that can determine the likelihood of survival for passengers aboard the Titanic based on various features such as age, sex, class, and other relevant information.

## Features

- **Data Cleaning:** Handled missing data and performed necessary transformations.
- **Feature Engineering:** Created new features to improve model accuracy.
- **Data Visualization:** Used libraries like Matplotlib and Seaborn to explore the data.
- **Model Building:** Implemented various machine learning models, including Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forest.
- **Model Evaluation:** Evaluated models using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

## Tools & Libraries

- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/krithikajagannathan/titanic-survival-rate-prediction.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd titanic-survival-rate-prediction
    ```
3. Open the notebook in Google Colab by uploading the `titanic_survival_rate_prediction.ipynb` file to Colab.
4. Run the cells in the notebook to see the analysis and results.

## Results

The best performing model achieved an accuracy of [Insert Accuracy]% on the test data, with [Insert Other Metrics] indicating robust performance in predicting survival rates.
